QemuTubes README
==================

Note
~~~~
  This is the standard Pyramid/Paster readme. I'll jazz this up
  later. The instructions below assume a virtual environment, and
  the .ini configuration file has some required extra options. 

Getting Started
---------------

- cd <directory containing this file>

- $venv/bin/python setup.py develop
